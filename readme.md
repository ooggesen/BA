In the Pulseq measurements the same MaRCoS system was used but the MaRCoS experiments were taken from Ruben Pellicer (https://github.com/RPellicer/marcos_experiments). The files can be found in the Rubens_MaRCoS_Experiments folder in the repository.

All this information is also listed in the bachelorthesis at page 25.
